That means you have to add the difference between how the ereader counts pages and the printed page number. To find the difference you need to add to the interaction script page numbers, open the XPS in XPS Viewer and start counting from the cover to the first printed page number. Add this number to the page number indicated in the interaction script and put that value above. -->
