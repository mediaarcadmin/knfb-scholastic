<div style=font-family:arial;font-size:35px;padding:20px;>
The following policy applies to SCHOLASTIC.COM  and any other site owned and/or operated by or on behalf of Scholastic Inc. or  any of its subsidiaries, that states that it is governed by this Privacy Policy  and/or links to this Privacy Policy (the sites and entities collectively  referred to herein as &quot;Scholastic.com&quot; and/or &quot;Scholastic&quot;  respectively).<br />
<br />
Scholastic is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online  visitors. This policy statement provides our visitors (e.g., parents, teachers,  librarians, and children) with an overview of the measures we have taken to  provide a safe online environment.<br />
<br />
This Privacy Policy applies to our online practices only, except the Opt-Out  procedure below also applies to our offline collection of personal information.

<h3>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h3>
We consider the following, among other things, to be personally identifiable  information: first and last name, e-mail address, street address and phone  number.<br />
<br />
We (and/or our agents or affiliates) may collect online and use personally  identifiable information from our adult visitors: (1) to process and fulfill  orders for products or services (such as our magazines); (2) in connection with  contests, sweepstakes, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations,  content submissions, classroom activities, our requests for suggestions and  visitors' requests for information; and (3) to customize the content on our  site for our visitors' current and future needs. In addition, this personally  identifiable information may be used to provide our visitors, via e-mail or  other means, information about materials and activities that may be of interest  to them, including products or services of third parties. For these reasons, we  may share such information with third parties. If you are an individual who has  provided us with your personal information online or offline and you do not  want us to share your information with third parties, or if there is a media  notification that you no longer wish to receive from us, please let us know by  sending us your name, address, e-mail and phone number at: Opt-Out Request,  Scholastic Inc., 557 Broadway &mdash; Room 4010, New York, NY 10012. If you are  writing to request that you no longer receive a particular media notification  from us, please include the name of the media notification. In addition, in  every e-mail that we send, we provide a link that you can click on to enable  you to opt out of receiving future e-mails from the sender.

<h3>FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS</h3>
There are many activities on the Scholastic site that children can participate  in and enjoy without having to share personally identifiable information.<br />
<br />
For those activities that require personally identifiable information, such as  contests and sweepstakes, in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Scholastic will not condition a  child's participation in an activity on that child disclosing more personally  identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to administer the  activity. For certain online activities, we may require verifiable parental  consent before collecting or using personally identifiable information from  children under the age of 13. With these activities, Scholastic will notify the  respective parent of our privacy policy and obtain verifiable parental consent  before collecting personally identifiable information from the child, unless we  collect only the child's name and online contact information to: (1) obtain  parental consent or provide parents with notice; (2) respond directly on a  one-time basis to a child's specific request; (3) respond more than once to a  child's specific request along with providing parental notice of such use; (4)  protect the safety of a child; or (5) comply with legal requirements. When we  provide parents with notice and/or seek consent, we also give parents the  ability to let us know if they do not want any further use made of the personally  identifiable information we have collected from their child. Parents can  request to review or have deleted their child's personally identifiable  information from Scholastic's records, and refuse to permit further use of a  child's personally identifiable information by writing to us at: e-Scholastic,  557 Broadway, New York, New York 10012, Re: Parent's Request for Information.  Parents can also print, complete and return <a href="parent-request.html" target="_blank">this letter</a> to the specified address.<br />
<br />
Unless we indicate otherwise and obtain prior parental consent, personally  identifiable information collected from children under the age of 13 will be  used solely by Scholastic or Scholastic's contractors or agents for internal purposes (such as sweepstakes administration and services related to the operation of our site) and will  not be sold or otherwise transferred to third parties.<br />
<br />
It is Scholastic's policy never to post on its site more than a child's first  name, first initial of last name, state, and age or grade.

<h3>FOR TEACHERS</h3>
There are many activities on the Scholastic site that are for teachers, which  enable teachers to add another dimension to their classroom and students'  activities. In order to create such online classroom activities, we will  collect personally identifiable information from teachers and have teachers  provide a password to their students so that students can publish materials  online and do other activities online in connection with their class through  the use of such password. We will only enable such passwords with the  verifiable consent provided by teachers acting on behalf of parents.<br />
<br />
A teacher may revoke the consent she has provided on behalf of her students'  parents, or inquire about personally identifiable information that has been  collected from a student  by  writing to us at: e-Scholastic, 557 Broadway, New York, New York 10012, Re:  Teacher's Request for Information. Teachers can also print, complete and return <a href="teacher-request.html" target="_blank">this  letter</a> to the specified address.<br />
<br />
When teachers register with our site, we use their sign-in information, which  contains personally identifiable information, to ensure that only the teacher  who has signed in has access to his or her personal areas of the site. For  example, only registered teachers are permitted to administer Class Homepages.  Access to administer a teacher's Class Homepage is controlled via that  teacher's personal username and password, which was established during the  registration process.

<h3>FOR KIDS</h3>
Remember to be smart online. Do not give out your full name, e-mail address,  home address, telephone number or any other personal information that would  enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your  parent or guardian for permission. Sometimes on our Scholastic site we will ask  you for your first name and e-mail address along with your parents' e-mail  address. We do this so that we can contact your parents to let them know that  you have communicated with us, and that we have collected this information from  you.

<h3>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND THE USE OF COOKIE TECHNOLOGY</h3>
We collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of a  software technology called &quot;cookies,&quot; through pixel tags, and through our visitors'  voluntary submissions to us and/or upon our request. By non-personally  identifiable information, we are referring to information about our visitors'  browsers (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), operating systems  (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM)  and other similar information which we track in aggregate form. We also collect  the following non-personally identifiable information in connection with  content submissions, games, classrooms, and bulletin boards: first name only  and first initial of last name, state, age, and grade. The non-personally  identifiable information that we track is anonymous and will never be  identified with or lead us back to any of our visitors.<br />
<br />
Cookie technology helps us to know how many people visit us and where visitors  go on our site. Cookies are small bits of information we send to your computer.  Pixel tags are very small graphic images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as "web beacons" or "clear GIFs".  The site may also use cookies known as “Flash” cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of the user’s computer or device using the Adobe Flash media player that is installed on it. Among other things, the non-personally identifiable information collected through these means allows us to  know which areas are favorites, which areas need a bit of improvement, or what  technologies and Internet services are being used by our visitors so that we  may continually improve our visitors' online experiences.<br />
<br />
Most web browsers give you a way to refuse or disable most cookies (but not Flash cookies).  To refuse or disable Flash cookies, you must set the Flash player on your computer or device to reject or delete them.  If you choose to disable, refuse, reject or delete cookies, some of the functionality of our site may no longer be available to you.  

<h3>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</h3>
We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of  Scholastic.com. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a Web  server when you're on the Web. When you are on our site, we have a back-end  server that logs your computer's IP address. We only use the information we find  out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered  a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify  an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a user if  we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply  with legal requirements. 

<h3>THIRD-PARTY SERVERS</h3>
We use third-party companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site and to  monitor traffic to our Web site. These companies may (via cookies, gifs or  otherwise) use aggregate information (not including your name, address, e-mail  address, telephone number, or any other personally identifiable information)  about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide us with data  about our site and/or to provide advertisements about goods and services of  interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to  know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<a name="shopping_guarantee"></a><h3>SECURITY</h3>
Scholastic ensures that all personally and non-personally identifiable  information that it receives via the Internet is secure against unauthorized  access. This information is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from  direct connection to the Internet. This means that no eyes but ours or those of contractors and agents performing services for us will ever  see the information that our visitors send to us, unless we indicate otherwise.  We will give out personal information as required by law, for example to comply  with a court order or subpoena or to assist in criminal investigations. We may  also give out personal information when we deem it advisable in order to  protect the safety and security of our sites and visitors to our sites.<br />
<br />
<b>Why are we so safe?</b><br />
Scholastic uses secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line to  protect your credit card information. It encrypts all of your personal and  credit card information so that this information cannot be read as it travels  to our ordering system, and once it is received, it is stored in a location not  accessible via the Internet.<br />
<br />
<b>More Guarantee Details</b><br />
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more  than $50 of unauthorized charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of  this $50, Scholastic will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full  $50. Note that, in the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must  notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and  procedures.

<h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
Visitors will find links from Scholastic.com to independently owned, controlled  and/or managed World Wide Web or Internet sites whose content we have found of  possible interest to our visitors. In many cases, but not always, the links  represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the  organizations connected with these sites. While we initially visit these sites  to which we directly link, please note that we do not monitor or control the  content that appears on these sites and such content may be constantly  changing. We recommend that children check with their parents or teachers  before clicking off to any new sites, and we encourage all end users of  Scholastic.com to read the privacy policies of all linked sites before  navigating through them.<br />
<br />
Please note that we may revise our above policy without notice to users as the  content on our sites continues to change and we will post all such material  changes on this Privacy Policy.<br />

We hope that you enjoy exploring our sites.<br />
