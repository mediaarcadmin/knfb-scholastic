		You walk towards the SKILL door and it slides open to reveal a dark room beyond. Once again, you step through. The door slides shut behind you and the lights snap on.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		There is only one other door in the room, directly opposite to you. On the door are the words REMEMBER ME, and a strange symbol underneath. You look closely at the symbol, sure that it will be important later.

		<p>
		After you’ve stared at the symbol for a while, you figure it’s time to get moving.
