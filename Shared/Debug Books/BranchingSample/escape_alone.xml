		<p>“[$FriendName$],” you say, “come over here and stand on this platform.”</p>

		<p>“Why?” he asks suspiciously.</p>

		<p>“Um, I have a feeling it might help us escape,” you say.</p>

		<p>He hesitates for a moment, and then steps onto the platform. The door slides open. Immediately, you dash toward the door, with just one backward glance to see [$FriendName$]’s startled face.</p>

		<p>As soon as you’re out, the door slides shut behind you. You are in a clearing in the woods. Behind you, there’s a solid rock face – you can’t even tell where the door used to be.</p>

		<p><span data-if="Supply == 'diamond'">You reach into your pocket and pull out the diamond. It is heavy in your hand and sparkles brilliantly in the light. Not only are you free… you’re rich! </span><span data-if="Supply != 'diamond'">Sunlight has never felt so good on your face. Fresh air has never smelled so wonderful.</span> You head off into the forest, hoping to find a way home.
