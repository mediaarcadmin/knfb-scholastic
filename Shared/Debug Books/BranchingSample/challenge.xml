	<p>You walk again toward the IN door. It slides open, and this time you force yourself to step through. Immediately, the door slides shut behind you. For a few moments, the new room is dark, and then the lights snap on. </p>

	<p>The new room is similar to the one you just left, but written on the floor in huge black letters are the words “CHOOSE YOUR CHALLENGE.” There are three more doors on the opposite side of the room, and each has a word printed on it in large, black letters:</p>

	<p>The first door says “SKILL”.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The second door says “COURAGE”.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The third door says “MEMORY”.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p style="font-weight: bold">Which door do you choose?</p>
