		<p>You walk toward the OUT door. It slides open, and this time you force yourself to step through. Immediately, the door slides shut behind you. For a few moments, the new room is dark, and then the lights snap on.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		This room is similar to the first. There’s the door you came through and another door on the opposite wall. On a third wall are three cubbyholes indented into the wall, with a large black word printed over them: SUPPLIES.
		</p>
		
		<p>You look closer and see that each cubbyhole has something inside. The first has a bag of sand. The second has a large diamond. The third has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
		</p>
		
		<p style="font-weight: bold">Which one do you take?</p>
