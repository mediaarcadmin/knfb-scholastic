	You pick up the ball. You can make this throw, you tell yourself. Waiting will only make it harder. With your eye on the button, you wind up and hurl the ball.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Perfect! It hits the button right in the center. The button pops in with a satisfying click. From the far side of the pit, a hidden bridge slides out, connecting to your side. You walk across the bridge. The far door slides open and you go through.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now you’re in a hallway, walls and ceiling the same white as the rooms. The door slides shut behind you. There’s nowhere to go but forward.
