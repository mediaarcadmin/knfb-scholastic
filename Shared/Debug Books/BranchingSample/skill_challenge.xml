		<p>You walk toward the SKILL door and it slides open to reveal a dark room beyond. Once again, you step through. The door slides shut behind you and the lights snap on.</p>

		<p>On the far side of the room is another door. But between you and the door is a deep pit that runs the width of the room. You walk closer and peer over the edge. It goes down as far as you can see until it disappears into blackness.</p>

		<p>The pit is clearly too wide to jump across. Is this a dead end? Then you notice a large red button on wall on the far side of the room, labeled with the word “BRIDGE”. And on your side of the room, wedged in a corner, you see a baseball.</p>

		<p>You’re pretty sure that you need to throw the baseball to hit the button. And you’re pretty sure that you’ll only have one shot at it.</p>
