Out of the tin WSDL2ObjC works fine with the Scholastic web service. However this
is not the case with the LibreAccess web service. Therefore we have made some 
changes to:

* make sure Scholastic remains functional;
* make sure LibreAccess can be used; and
* make life a little easier.

The changes that have been made include:

* fix for http escaping
* fix for methods that do not have any parameters
* added option: Remove parameter namespace, for LibreAccess the SOAP envelope does
  not contain the namespace in the markup
* added option: exclude SOAP 1.1/1.2, only generate code for SOAP 1.1/1.2
* added option: exclude http/https, only generate code for http/https

The final two options together fix a problem with LibreAccess where duplicate 
bindings were being generated and causing 1k's of duplicate method errors.

Please make sure you check the history of changes for further changes that have 
been made.

Here are the settings we've used:

Scholastic Authenticate.wsdl / GetUserInfo.wsdl / WishList.wsdl

☑ Add tag to service name (avoid name conflicts)
